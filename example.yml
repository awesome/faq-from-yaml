        How do I improve the focus?
      nickname: focus
      answer: >
        The focal length of the device is designed to be similar to traditional devices, but the view interface
        can take some getting used to. Let us know if you have continued difficulty capturing great images.

        My images are too bright, how do I turn the light down?
      nickname: brightness
      answer: >
        If your images consistently too bright or seem over-exposed you can decrease the illumination
        using the brightness slider in the camera view on the app. If that doesn't help, give us call or visit
        [https://www.example.com/support].
